youlin = "Machinery and Technology are symbols of the Terrans. Infiltrators’ black armor can cloak them on the battlefield, making it hard for the enemy to detect and defend them. Armor installed with an emotion suppressor, Infiltrators can stay absolutely calm, killing lives without mercy, as if they are straws which are about to be reaped."
yiliao = "Human is one of the three big races in Art of War: Red Tides; they are known for their technology and machine developments. On the crucial battlefield, Medic got the most attention both for their appearance and ability. They are fighting against the strongest enemy – the death lord."
hlts = "The Atlac enjoys highly-developed civilization. Hierophants have been always trying to master the secrets and abilities of super life forms through spiritual practice. They often travel among galaxies to search for and study ores whose structure is similar to that of the crystalcore. Sometimes they even integrate themselves with those ores."
